# AWS Doorman

AWS Doorman is a simple utility for facilitating access to AWS ressources that have restricted access by IP.

It keeps the entries of a prefix list up to date with the actual external IP.

How it works:

* It retrieves the computer's external IP and adds it to an AWS Managed Prefix List.
* It checks regularly what the IP is and updates the Prefix List entries as needed.
* It removes the IP when shutting down.
* It works on Managed Prefix List entries that have a specific description.

This is a tool I have developed as I've been working from home on a connection without a fixed IP address.
The main use is avoiding a VPN connection which tends to not work too well on spotty cellular networks.

The main use case is when a direct connection is necessary, e.g when using [Mosh], which requires UDP.

In the general case, prefer connecting via [AWS Session Manager].


## Status

Development is in its early stages. It works for me Â®, but your mileage may vary.

### Known limitations

* No IPv6 support.
* No multi-home support.


## Running

For the full list of options:

```
aws_doorman -h
```

There is no support for using AWS IAM Roles directly. It expects to retrieve the credentials from the usual places.

I recommend using it with [AWS Vault]. AWS Vault handles assuming roles and
dealing with MFA.

Example using default credentials from `~/.aws/credentials`:

```
aws_doorman --prefix-list-id pl-1234567890abcdef1 --description some-description --interval 120
```

Example using AWS role *some-role* from AWS Vault:

```
aws-vault exec --prompt=zenity some-role -- aws_doorman --prefix-list-id pl-1234567890abcdef1 --description some-description --interval 120
```


## Building

Doorman is developed on up-to-date Linux and MacOS using the latest Rust toolchain.
It may work on Windows too, but it's not tested.

To build for production:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Requirements

These are the requirements for building. They are needed by [external-ip] which depends on c-ares.

* automake
* libssl-dev
* libtool


### Notable dependencies

* [external-ip]: Library to guess external IP from various sources
* [rusoto]: Rust AWS SDK


## Development

Contributions in the form of pull requests, issues, etc are welcome.

Useful plugins:

* [cargo-with] - Allows running a wrapper program to set environment variables.
Useful for temporary AWS credentials during development.
